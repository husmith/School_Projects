In order to have my classes work with games that include jokers, I would need to make sure that the two jokers has numbers that corresponded with their playing card. Since, jokers do not belong to a suit (there is simply a red and black joker), their number would be unique to a color. For example, 52 would be the red joker and 53 would be the black. To avoid remaking the dictionaries of the suits and ranks (messing up the suit and rank functions), I would create a Card subclass Joker, that overrides the __init__, rank, suit, and points methods of Card. In the game War, the joker trumps all cards. In the Card class __init__ I would include an if statement for card.number ==52 or 53 that then assigns the card as a Joker. For the Deck class, I would need to include a range of 54.
