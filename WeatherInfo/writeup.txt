In this program I utilized the sys, urllib.request, and json libraries. From the sys module, I imported the argv message in order to parse the arguments from the command line. From the urllib.request module I imported the urlopen, which I used in my get_weather() function to open the url. The get_weather() function is passed 'city', which is the city name parsed from the command line. It creates a url to fetch the weather and retrieves the data. The data is then read with the loads method from the json module, which converts the json string to a dictionary. This allows me to find the weather and main keys (and therefore the weather description and temp to the corresponding keys) through indexing. I then chose to print the output from within the function, instead of getting the values form the function call. I accessed the 7 day forecast by altering the url to cnt=7, and I was able to convert temperature values into fahrenheit by setting the mode=imperial. I wasn't able to figure out how to print the name of the day (e.g. Monday, Tuesdayâ€¦), but I avoided this by simply printing the day number associated with the data. In the future, I would like to figure out how to convert the weather id into the corresponding date (as you see with XML output).
